Here comes the Sun, doo-doo-doo-doo
Here comes the Sun and I say
It's all right
Little darling
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the Sun, doo-doo-doo-doo
Here comes the Sun and I say
It's all right
Little darling
The smiles returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the Sun
Here comes the Sun and I say
It's all right
